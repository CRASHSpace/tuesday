Your REVAMPED weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

This second Tuesday Sweep of the revised zone system focuses on “Identity.” Yours, and how not to get it stolen. I spent a bunch of quality time with my password manager today, changing passwords it considered weak, cleaning out duplicates, sometimes deleting an account all together if I didn’t really use it anyway.

#### This Week’s Focus: Zone 3 – Permission

The old saying goes “if you give ’em an inch, they’ll take a mile,” and for many technology products that seems to be their motto for data collection. But not all products, and not all setting levels on all products. This week thing about the items and software you’ve let in the door, so to speak, and make sure they are being proper guests.

##### Start Up

*   Write another list, this one’s harder. Who do you give data to? Who takes it without asking? It can be impossible to know. Social networks, email, home IoT, fitness apps, meditation apps, navigation apps, online video games, most of these entities will at least keep a record of where you logged in from at what time. What are their privacy policies? Do your best. This step can be overwhelming. Maybe tackle one class of data collector per month to keep from going nuts.
*   Check your Facebook settings and download your data , if applicable
*   Check your Google settings and download your data , if applicable
*   Check your [Amazon settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/amazon-privacy-shopping/) and … opps you can’t download your data.
*   Check the privacy settings on your mobile devices
*   Check the privacy settings of your IoT devices
*   Check the privacy settings on online accounts, especially social media.
*   Install privacy Badger and/or an Ad Blocker (and HTTPs everywhere if you missed it week 1)
*   Create a system for archiving your email offline
*   Check [how trackable your browser is](https://panopticlick.eff.org/), even without cookies
*   Download software to strip EXIF data from images, and use it before sharing pictures
*   Learn how to sniff the traffic leaving your devices

##### Maintain

*   Double check privacy settings, especially on mobile devices
*   Clear browsing history & logs on computers, on mobile devices
*   Check the privacy setting on social media accounts
*   Check for updates for IoT devices and their current privacy settings
*   Transfer email to offline archive, delete email off the server that is more than 6 months old
*   Delete your browsing histories and logs where you can find them.
*   Delete software from devices that never gets used. The download files or disk images can be archived to a hard drive if you’re worried about never being able to find it again.
*   Software as a service check:
    *   Are all your subscription up to date?
    *   Anyone billing you who shouldn’t be?
*   On a fun note, go through photos/videos taken over the last month. Sure, delete some, but really mark the ones you think you might care about at the end of the year.

### Learn

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/)?

*   Check out the links on the [News and Updates](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/learn/01-news.html) page.

### Reflect

Feeling dumb or stupid about how not-l33t you are? Angsting over some silly thing you “know better than to do.” Stop. That isn’t useful. Regret is only of use if it prompts an actual change in behavior. Maybe it’s NOT you that sucks. Could be it’s the technology, and _you_ could come up with a fix that would help lots of people.
