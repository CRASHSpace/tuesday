Once a quarter it's time to revisit some of the more time consuming tasks. At the start of the year it's maybe time to hit up some of the more organizational tasks.

## How's the Tuesday Sweep been working for you?
* Is the day and time right?
* Is it time to update your threat model?
* Is your check list still appropriate?
* Is where you get your news still current?

## Back Ups, Updates, Certificates

*   Try restoring your systems from back up. It’s not a [back-up system](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-sweep-where-are-your-backups/) if it doesn’t work.
*   If you don’t have a cloud-based back up program, when was the last time you swapped the offsite copy of your files?
*   SSL Certificates for your sites. When do they expire?

## Software Review
*   Fall quarter emphasized planning software updates and code overhauls. What have you done?
*   Software as a service check:
  * Are all your subscription up to date?
  * Anyone billing you who shouldn't be? (Check your credit card bills for misc charges)  

## Hardware Review

*   What new hardware do you have? Is it set up correctly? How does it stay up to date and backed up? Is it on your check list?
*   What hardware seems on it's last legs? Hardrive motors likely to fail?
*   Batteries get old, how’s yours doing? Can it be replaced?
*   [Oil your paper shredder](https://lifehacker.com/5875771/oil-your-paper-shredder-with-canola-oil-to-keep-it-running-in-top-shape).

## Personal Information & Emergency Supplies

*   Get a copy of a credit report from a different reporting bureaus than you did last fall. Check to make sure your credit is still frozen.
*   When was the last time you checked the validity of your Emergency Plan and the content of both your stay-kit and go-bag?
    *   [California Resources](http://www.caloes.ca.gov/)
    *   [Federal Resources](https://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan)
    *   [SF72.org](http://www.sf72.org/) (San Francisco Department of Emergency Management)
*   What is perishable in your emergency kit? What is it time to rotate? (Energy bars? Water? Batteries?)
*   Anything to add to stay-kit or go-bag?
