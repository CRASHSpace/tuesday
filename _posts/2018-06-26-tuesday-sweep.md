Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/06/tuesday-sweep-26-june-2018/)
*   [On the repo](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/tuesdaysweep/2018/06/26/tuesday-sweep.html)

Once again skimming the late release on the Tuesday Sweep. For me that’s because I got sidelined by the combination of this week’s zone “Leave It Better” and the weekly task of a neglected inbox.

I have [HTTPs Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) installed, set to block all non-HTTPs connections. It’s brutal. I couldn’t actually load my own (very neglected) websites! Today I fixed that. Thank you [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)! (Donate if you use ’em, if you can.)

As I was poking around my hosting service’s settings for setting up SSL, I realized that I had an old email address still active that I hadn’t checked in 5+ _years._ Yikes. I hate email. So I’ve been slowly cleaning that out one slow webmail screen of 100 messages at a time. It feels good, though, to purge the trash. It’s so easy to make digital waste disappear, but it’s making me think of all the trash in the real world. That’s historically been a real health problem, but we’ve banded together through government and [created municipal waste services,](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/a-brief-history-of-garbage-232332) even if the solutions aren’t ideal. If you’ve never run a business and had to pay for private trash collection, it’s hard to overstate what a value public trash collection represents. On a daily behavior front, the [anti-litter campaigns](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/business/media/decades-after-a-memorable-campaign-keep-america-beautiful-returns.html) of the 70’s and ’80s have done their work on me and I have a visceral negative reaction to the idea of becoming a [litterbug](https://youtu.be/QsOK1Gc-or8?t=6m33s). [Public campaigns can work](https://www.adcouncil.org/content/download/1283/11304/file/advertising-that-changed-a-nation.pdf) (PDF). It can take [as little as 25% of a population](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/the-tipping-point-when-minority-views-take-over/562307/) to buy in to make lasting change in a culture. We can be that change in online culture. It’s worth it.

### Learn

#### News and Updates

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/), include a politics update! This sections gonna be slapdash because the Zone 03 reorg took some time

*   If you’re in [District 53](http://www.legislature.ca.gov/legislators_and_districts/districts/assemblydistricts_LA.html), [Miguel Santiago](https://votesmart.org/candidate/campaign-finance/151853/miguel-santiago) just hamstrung the CA [Net Neutrality Bill](https://gizmodo.com/california-lawmaker-under-fire-for-weakening-net-neutra-1827053017). Just saying. Maybe you should give him a call.
*   Also this week in CA: “[California Has 48 Hours to Pass This Privacy Bill or Else](https://gizmodo.com/california-has-48-hours-to-pass-this-privacy-bill-or-el-1827117016)“
*   You can legally ignore [Warranty Void If Removed stickers](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/11/601582169/warranty-void-if-removed-as-it-turns-out-feds-say-those-warnings-are-illegal) it seems. That’s cool. Bummed that wasn’t legal precedent for digital poking around, too.
*   [Protest without strategy is performance](https://boingboing.net/2018/06/25/protest-without-strategy-is-pe.html).
*   So _MAYBE_ email will start being safer? EFF announces another new tool, this time for mailadmins. Check out the announcement for [STARTTLS](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/announcing-starttls-everywhere-securing-hop-hop-email-delivery)
*   I love this: “[Senator to FCC: How much do police stingrays drain a cell phone battery?](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/senator-to-fcc-what-do-you-know-about-stingrays-ability-to-disrupt-911-calls/)“
*   Please keeping poking around for your own news to check this week! I’ve got still more emails to delete. LOL.
