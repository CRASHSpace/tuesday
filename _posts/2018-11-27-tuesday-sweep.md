Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/09/tuesday-sweep-27-november-2018/)

*   [See all the zones](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/)

Zone 4 this week. “Leave it Better,” focusing on making sure your own projects are in order. On that note, now’s the time to mention that this will be the last Tuesday Sweep post of the year! All the websites will start posting their 2018 retrospectives soon, and it’s time to take stock about what has worked and what hasn’t in these sweeps. Maybe 2019 will have an actual editorial schedule? Wouldn’t that be a hoot.
