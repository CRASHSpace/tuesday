Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/10/tuesday-sweep-9-october-2018/)
*   [On the repo](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/tuesdaysweep/2018/10/09/tuesday-sweep.html)
*   [See all the zones](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/)

Zone 02, “identity,” how to increase the chances they you’re you and they’re them when interacting with people online.

Sadly, part of my identity is migraine sufferer. I had one last week. Go figure. I’ve learned that when ever possible, it’s better not to go back and try go back and do missed tasks. If I try to back fill, that just leaves me constantly feeling behind. I try to focus on todays priorities today and get as far as I can. So I didn’t do the Tuesday Sweep on Wednesday last week. I just dropped it, knowing I could pick it up today. It’s like being a musician in an band, when you loose your place it’s not about “catching up” but simply a matter of rejoining the song at the current bar without making a big fuss about it.
