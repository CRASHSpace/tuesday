### Learn

#### News and Updates

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/)? Some of these links are a bit older because the last two weeks were all about the election.

*   Even Ars Technica is [talking about our wildfires](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/what-is-going-on-with-californias-horrific-fires/).
*   Check out videos of what you missed at the [Hackaday Superconference 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-66i7vM00vo&list=PL_tws4AXg7atlDjmfZLL93H987EU7Mb7U)

*   [The Privacy Battle to Save Google From Itself](https://www.wired.com/story/google-privacy-data/)
*   Some “Encrypted SSD Hardrives” [aren’t really](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flaws-in-popular-ssd-drives-bypass-hardware-disk-encryption/), and can even do an end run around Windows’ BitLocker.
*   It should be safe to update Windows now, but the bugs give an insight into [Microsoft’s Update process](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/windows-10-october-2018-update-is-back-this-time-without-deleting-your-data/).
*   I LOVE the USPS. It’s fun to kick it, but they really do an amazing job. That said, just please [wait for your mail to arrive](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/u-s-secret-service-warns-id-thieves-are-abusing-uspss-mail-scanning-service/) to know what’s in it. At least for a little while longer.
*   [The Chalubo BotNet](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2018/10/22/chalubo-botnet-wants-to-ddos-from-your-server-or-iot-device/), the BotNet with the funnest name to say. Excellent write up.
*   I’m keeping my eye on [IncludeOS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-security-and-linux-why-includeos-thinks-it-has-the-edge/), perhaps a better answer than embedded linux for IoT
*   Learn about infrastructure: Strange snafu [misroutes domestic US Internet traffic through China Telecom](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/strange-snafu-misroutes-domestic-us-internet-traffic-through-china-telecom/)
*   Oh goodness Google is making. [reCAPTCHA’s based on websites norms](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-launches-recaptcha-v3-that-detects-bad-traffic-without-user-interaction/). I mean maybe yay? I mean maybe kinda creepier? Maybe they’ll be using the data from [Project Fi’s VPN](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/google-adds-always-on-vpn-to-its-project-fi-cellular-service/)
