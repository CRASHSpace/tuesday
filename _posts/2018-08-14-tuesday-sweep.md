Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/08/tuesday-sweep-14-august-2018/)
*   [On the repo](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/tuesdaysweep/2018/08/14/tuesday-sweep.html)
*   [See all the zones](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/)

Zone 02, the tasks beyond the basics center on “identity,” how to increase the chances they you’re you and they’re them. I had some fun today setting up some Keys… RSA SSH keys, to be exact. This might be a good time to review that, if you haven’t thought about it in awhile. The first three videos cover the theory, the last two cover how to use ’em.

*   [Using SSH Keys to Connect to your Droplet (Mac)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69K-sCTpDg&t=311s)

And why was I generating keys? I decided it would be fun, instead of complaining how everyone else is doing it wrong, to highlight some promising projects.

I could have written a panegyric, but instead of that essay we have [a Mastodon instance for CRASH Space](https://toot.crashspace.org/about) that took about an afternoon to set up. FWIW, I have LAMP stack web dev experience (perl, php and python), but minimal rails experience and hadn’t worked with docker before. These guides were the most help.
