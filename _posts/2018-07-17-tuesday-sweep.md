Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/07/tuesday-sweep-17-july-2018/)
*   [On the repo](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/tuesdaysweep/2018/07/17/tuesday-sweep.html)
*   [See all the zones](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/)

Zone 3 this week. Permissions are this week’s focus! Getting clear on who as access to your data, and of those that do, who asked for your informed, affirmative consent, and who are the chuckle heads who did not.

Maintaining a focus takes work. I try to only check certain types of news once a week. The practice helps me see that so much doesn’t change. So many new incendiary headlines generated every day tugging eyeballs this way and that. But these headlines just look like herd of shambler zombies when viewed all together. Repetitive, brain eating outrage without any actionable information. Who has the time?

Letting the latest crazy headline jerk you away from your current project only serves the people who want you to fail. And so much on the internet wants you to fail. Wants you to look at some “OMG YOU HAVE TO SEE” article instead keeping your eyes on the prize. And this all ties back to permissions because data aggregators know exactly how to make us jump track because they watch with all the loving attention of a predator.

Changing course needs to be a decision, not a reaction. For me right now I have some topics that I’m choosing to emphasize. I’m kinda all about preserving democracy right now. I hope others are choosing other things. There’s enough work to do to uplift humanity and frankly it’s all connected. Choose whatever, but just choose something and… persist.

Helpful because it provides some templates on how to do the former.
