Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

Welcome to a Fifth Tuesday of the month!

<rant>I am going to interrupt the regular spiel so we can all take a moment of silence for the hours we’ve lost to trouble shooting Calendar Issues in programing. OMG. It’s so dumb!!! If you ever need to figure out [what all the Tuesdays are in a year](https://gist.github.com/carlynorama/3fe8daf9d2e561ca5faca44fcf48298f), or [how many Tuesdays are in each month](https://gist.github.com/carlynorama/357b33a0528d87ab4da9bb4150ef0188), [is today Tuesday](https://gist.github.com/carlynorama/abd820e9b1dd015159223fc8e57a2312), or if [any old date is a Tuesday](https://gist.github.com/carlynorama/d2ffde339f6749d8cb09e7179a44a825)… well, thank goodness other people’s code have made that easier over the years, but yuck. Time. It just keeps on slipping. </rant>

The lack of regularity has made it a challenge to figure out what to have, if anything for a “Zone 5.” What, if anything, needs to be done at such strange intervals? My answer? Taking a break. Taking a break is what needs to happen erratic intervals. So just do the basics, and the couple of things mentioned in the learn section (RESET YOUR ROUTER) and enjoy a lighter week.
