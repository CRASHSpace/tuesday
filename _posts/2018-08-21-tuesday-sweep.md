Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/08/tuesday-sweep-21-august-2018/)
*   [On the repo](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/tuesdaysweep/2018/08/21/tuesday-sweep.html)
*   [See all the zones](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/)

Zone 03, Permissions, who gets to see what and when. And if were talking about the [Mastodon instance](https://toot.crashspace.org)… I get to see it all!!! MWwwaahhhahahah.

In [announcement](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/08/crash-space-joins-the-fediverse/) and the [FAQ](https://blog.crashspace.org/membership/mastodon-instance-faq/) about our Mastodon instance I felt it was important to mention that the ActivityPub protocol keeps all the [pitfalls of email](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-embrace-the-postcard-nature-of-email/), leaving admins like me with God Powers over the content on the servers. The fact that CS members know me could be considered reassuring or stifling depending on the day. Would you rather be in a big city or a small town? At least in the Fediverse small towns actually get a say in how they’re run. Small towns create a much stronger social contract, i.e. Tod would totally rat me out if I start spending my days reading other people’s private messages. That said, in the long run, I’d like to see more situations where we don’t have to trust the pinky swear “It’s safe because I said so!” Moving this needle will likely take setting up regulations and governing bodies and auditors so nothing will be changing over night. In the mean time, please do have fun in the Fediverse, but if you want to send something more private, [use Signal](https://signal.org/).

### Learn

#### News and Updates

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/), include a politics update!

*   I spent too much time corrupting the Mastodon database, so I got nothing, well almost nothing:
*   [James Mickens on the Current State of Computer Security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/james_mickens_o.html) It’s basically a send up of the fervor around machine learning by a charismatic speaker.

[BAAAABBBBBYYYYY ELEPHANNNTTS!](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?q=Cute+elephants&nj=0&cat=pics) Browse while listening to [Baby Elephant Walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1z4JfxFb6c). I’m going to play it on loop every time I work on Mastodon now. New theme song for the rest of 2018 right here.
