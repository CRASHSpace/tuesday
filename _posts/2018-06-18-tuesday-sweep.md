Permission. The average user engages with technology as if it was all set up as opt-in, as if the technology they’ve invited into their homes and their lives will behave by the same unwritten rules as a human house guest. But unwritten rules cause problems. They have a sheen of universality when in actuality each rule has its root in specific cultural assumptions. Assuming other people or things will comply with the “unwritten rules” gets us all in deep deep trouble.

This week three of the month is all about permissions. Consider crafting, actually in writing, your own [personal terms of service](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/privacy-paradox-day-5-challenge/). This ties back to the [Beyoncé Rules](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-institute-beyonce-rules-for-vetting-apps/) thing to do from back in 2016, but then goes further. It’s so much easier to hold the line when you actually have defined the line. If it isn’t written down you may start to forget, try to put on [rose colored glasses](https://youtu.be/-3sJVm6KHhM?t=2m3s) to get along. The various [autocracy](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/11/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival/) [rules](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/one-year-after-trumps-election-revisiting-autocracy-rules-for-survival) [of survival](https://thecorrespondent.com/5696/were-heading-into-dark-times-this-is-how-to-be-your-own-light-in-the-age-of-trump/1611114266432-e23ea1a6) flag the slow shifting of norms as a threat, meaning to maintain values one has to be able to [remember](https://twitter.com/_RememberBot_) [what isn’t normal](https://medium.com/@Amy_Siskind).

It’s not normal for an entity to come into your life and immediately:

*   ask for the contact data of everyone you have ever met
*   start tracking you where ever you go
*   monitor all your communications and conversations
*   hand your secrets over to strangers as a way to earn points with them
*   control what you see as a way to manipulate your feelings
*   try to sell you things when you’re at your most vulnerable
*   stay even after you’ve asked them to leave

This is not normal. You deserve better. Require it.

#### This Week’s Focus:

This is Zone 03’s first month in the fragmented file structure with the shorter list of To-Do’s. I’m not thrilled with them all because it’s such a big topic, but we have to keep the list short to not make it overwhelming. Every month better, though. That’s the idea!

*   Spend 10 minutes moving unencrypted data (for example email) older than ~3 months old to offline archive. [(more)](https://carlynorama.github.io/tuesday/sweep/zone03/archive_data.html)
*   Keep using privacy minded browsers and search engines, Spend 5 minutes clearing cookies and history as needed. [(more)](https://carlynorama.github.io/tuesday/sweep/zone03/browser.html)
*   Check dockets. Call your reps. [(more)](https://carlynorama.github.io/tuesday/sweep/zone03/call_your_reps.html)

### Relax

If you’re thinking about resilience… think about what it take [to be a tree in Greenland](https://ign.ku.dk/english/about/arboreta/arboretum-greenland/forest-plantations/). Thank you Levi!

[Image is from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/marijuanaenthusiasts/comments/2xbj7g/tundraloving_arctic_willow_salix_arctica_is_the/) of the oldest known Arctic Willow (Salix arctica) was found in Greenland and was 236 years old.
