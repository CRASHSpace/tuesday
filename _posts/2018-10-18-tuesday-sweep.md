If splurging on fancy toiletries isn’t in the cards for you this week, even just spending some time sniffing the fruits and veggies in the grocery store can get some fun scents up your nose. Go ahead. People do all sorts of weird things to produce to see if it’s ripe. The staff won’t even notice you. Find your happy smell.
