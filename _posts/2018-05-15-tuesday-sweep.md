Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and I hope you went to the CRASH Space meeting…)

It’s been a super super long week for me, but I’m trying to model that it’s better to do a little bit when you can that to get hung up on being the perfect netizen all the time. Every file is made from bits. Toggle yours as you can.
