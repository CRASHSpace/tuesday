Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/09/tuesday-sweep-25-september-2018/)
*   [On the repo](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/tuesdaysweep/2018/07/24/tuesday-sweep.html)
*   [See all the zones](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/)

Zone 4 this week. “Leave it Better,” focusing on making sure your own projects are in order, like they’re [using HTTPS](https://doesmysiteneedhttps.com/). I’m adding a task to this zone. One way to improve your projects might be to consider using Docker. [Daryll is teaching a class](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/09/intro-to-docker-20180926/)… TOMORROW!!!

### Learn

#### News and Updates

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/), include a politics update!

*   *   I’m going to double down on [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/)‘s new book Click Here to Kill Everybody ([Author Page](https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/) | [Affiliate Link](https://amzn.to/2DtQkL1)). I bought it at the airport the other day and so far I think it would actually be pretty good for a smart motivated humanities major, which has been missing. It’s adamant about the problems without sounding like a ganglion of conspiracy theories.
    *   I’m going to call out one of my favorite newsletters again today: [SANs Newsbites](https://www.sans.org/newsletters/newsbites/xx/76)
