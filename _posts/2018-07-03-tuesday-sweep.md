Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

*   [On the blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/07/tuesday-sweep-3-july-2018/)
*   [On the repo](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/tuesdaysweep/2018/07/03/tuesday-sweep.html)
*   [See all the zones](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/)

I’ll admit, musings on authority theory line up thematically better with Zone 3 (“Permissions”) rather than Zone 1 (“Connectivity”), but today (or tomorrow) would be a great day to read the [Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript), highlighting that “consent of the governed” phrase. Although that concept didn’t [come](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/creating-the-united-states/interactives/declaration-of-independence/consent/index.html) [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79RApCgwZFw&t=5s) [a vacuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=u4_vwKyeG58), it still represents a big departure from the divine right of kings. I tried to track down good essays available without [a paywall](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/tocqueville-and-the-american-experiment.html) online, but, wow, mostly a bunch of complete nutters. That’s so tragic! The closest I can come up with in terms of quality reading is this entry on [Political Legitimacy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/) from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Also a 2012 talk by A. John Simmons called “[Democratic Authority and the Boundary Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1BNMiVVjoU)” at Harvard’s Kennedy School provides a nice survey of modern thought, regardless on whether or not you agree with his conclusions. It’s a long, graduate-level talk, but worth the effort.

Have a wonderful 4th of July, all. It’s okay to celebrate the good parts. It’s how we stand up to the bad.

### Learn

#### News and Updates

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/), include a politics update!

*   When you have C student writing policy you end up with ridiculousness like [tariffs on components](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/07/02/economy/will-tariffs-chinese-products-protect-us-jobs). It’s worth a nag to to your national officials if you don’t already have them on speed dial this week.
*   Tech companies are ALREADY [going after that privacy law](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2018/07/03/the-cybersecurity-202-big-tech-is-going-after-california-s-new-privacy-law/5b3a4e081b326b3348addc76/?utm_term=.981a55cbdfd2) that got passed last week. Call your state officials! After all, even MIT is on the [Down with Data Baron](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611425/its-time-to-rein-in-the-data-barons/)‘s band wagon.
*   There are plenty of real threats out there. We don’t have to [make new ones](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/06/conservation_of.html) just to keep our stimulus level high. It’s okay to take a moment to feel good about imperfect improvements.
*   [LTE has some unfixable flaws](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/lte-wireless-connections-used-by-billions-arent-as-secure-as-we-thought/) if you don’t enforce HTTPs connections. Time to ask the ITU to make sure that “the [5G specification](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/5g-imt-2020-specs/) [is]revised to make integrity assurance mandatory.” The flaw is currently expensive to exploit, btw. I just bring it up b/c it’s [technically interesting](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/07/traffic_analysi.html) and another excuse to encourage HTTPS.
*   [For victims of smart home abuse, there’s no easy out](https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/02/smart-home-abuse-no-easy-out/)
*   [Patch Windows, patch Adobe PDF readers](https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/windows-adobe-zero-exploit.html).
*   [Game Theory and BitTorrent](https://twitter.com/backus/status/999519259628732416)

### Relax

After the fireworks, maybe think about how to watch some of the fireworks there in the universe for us every night. Collect some ideas for [summer night star gazing](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/22/17479582/perseids-2018-delta-aquarid-saturn-opposition-mars-night-sky-summer) and maybe [a park pass](https://store.usgs.gov/recreational-passes) to go somewhere to really see them! Even if you can’t get outside, check out this gallery of images from the [Hubble Telescope](http://hubblesite.org/images/gallery).
