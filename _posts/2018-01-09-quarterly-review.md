So, I’ve been posting here every week to back up and update your gear. I talk a big game, but I get busy and goof off myself like everyone else. It makes sense to look at the bigger picture a few times a year and update what isn’t working. Also, some tasks that don’t need to be done every week, but should be done periodically. This isn’t a perfect list or a full one. Let me know what you think should be on the list in January!

## Back Ups, Updates, Certificates

*   Try restoring your systems from back up. It’s not a [back-up system](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-sweep-where-are-your-backups/) if it doesn’t work.
*   If you don’t have a cloud-based back up program, when was the last time you swapped the offsite copy of your files?
*   SSL Certificates for your sites. When do they expire?
*   Think about major software updates and code overhauls. Is there a new platform that would be a better choice for what you’re doing? This could be a new operating system, maybe a new language or looking into containers. Start planning this fall for the work you’ll do next year.

## Hardware Review

*   Things with moving parts are more likely to fail. What drives can you move to an SSD?
*   Batteries get old, how’s yours doing?
*   [Oil your paper shredder](https://lifehacker.com/5875771/oil-your-paper-shredder-with-canola-oil-to-keep-it-running-in-top-shape).
*   Holiday wishlist time, what might go on sale between now and the end of the year?

## Personal Information & Emergency Supplies

*   Get a copy of a credit report from one of the reporting bureaus. Check to make sure your credit is still frozen.
*   When was the last time you checked the validity of your Emergency Plan and the content of both your stay-kit and go-bag?
    *   [California Resources](http://www.caloes.ca.gov/)
    *   [Federal Resources](https://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan)
    *   [SF72.org](http://www.sf72.org/) (San Francisco Department of Emergency Management)
*   What is perishable in your emergency kit? What is it time to rotate? (Energy bars? Water? Batteries?)
*   Anything to add to stay-kit or go-bag?
