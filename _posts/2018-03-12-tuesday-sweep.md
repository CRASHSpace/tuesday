Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to go to the CRASH Space meeting…)

([Post on Blog](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/03/tuesday-sweep-12-march-2018/))

So I read an article yesterday about how folks in a small town in Indiana had [gotten mad, and then largely gotten over](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/03/11/feature/a-beloved-restaurant-owner-was-deported-a-community-was-in-uproar-then-it-moved-on/), the deportation of one of their local business leaders. It would be really easy to point the finger at these folks as uniquely callous, but I read it while having an interview with Paul Bloom on [why humans are cruel](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/12/14/16687388/violence-psychology-human-nature-cruelty) open in another tab. Large scale evil doesn’t happen because of psychopaths. There aren’t enough of them. Large scale evil happens because folks just try to get through their day minimizing discomfort. That’s so… natural. In addition to technology choices, we make clothing choices, food choices, transportation choices, job choices, investment choices, entertainment choices largely reflexively because we all just have [too much to think about](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/teacher-decision-fatigue/) to examine every decision everyday. Building sweeps like this into your life mean putting time in the calendar to be uncomfortable so when decision time comes you’ll already know where you stand.

While “[Yes, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...)” feels great, [boundaries matter](https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a18927393/saying-no-at-work/). Standing your ground can mean [practicing saying No](https://www.fastcompany.com/3053996/your-ultimate-guide-to-saying-no-to-people-you-cant-say-no-to) to people who are [hard to say no to](https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a18927393/saying-no-at-work/).

### Sweep

The basics slightly revised and with a [printable checklist](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/printable_checklist.html).

*   [Updated software](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-routine-update-everything/) recently? Pick a new device to check on today.
*   [Backups](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-sweep-where-are-your-backups/) still up and running? When was the last time you made a clean [disk image](https://blog.crashspace.org/2017/01/one-thing-to-do-today-keep-a-clean-disk-image-on-hand/)? Here’s a new great article on how to design [a backup system](https://www.grahamcluley.com/create-robust-data-backup-plan-make-sure-works/).
*   App, Password Gardening: Delete a [low quality app](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-institute-beyonce-rules-for-vetting-apps/) from your phone or [delete](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-turn-off-image-loading-for-email/) [an](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-turn-off-image-loading-for-email/) [account](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-delete-your-account/) that you don’t need that doesn’t make you happy. Digital cruft builds up. Delete it. If you’re keeping it, can you move the password to your [password manager](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-what-passwords-do-you-have-anyway/) (delete it from everywhere else) and add [two factor authentication](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-enable-two-factor-authorization/)?
*   Stored WiFi networks can be used to [profile your computer](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/when-apps-collude-to-steal-your-data/522177/) and find out [places you’ve been](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/your-android-device-telling-world-where-youve-been).

The folks running the companies can change the TOS and add “[features](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/facebook-groups-reducing-risks)” before you notice them.

### Learn

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/)?

*   This past weekend was [SCaLE 16x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x) and I totally forgot to mention it last week!! Headsmack. Can you believe that [videos are already available](https://www.youtube.com/user/socallinuxexpo/videos). The [SGVLUG](https://www.sgvlug.org/) pretty much super rocks.

I find this area of research more fascinating than scary for the metaphysics of it all. Yum.
*   Also tasty are these [punycode](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/look-alike-domains-and-visual-confusion/) exploits. I love anything that messes with how humans collect data vs how machines do. I get it. I’m weird.
*   When building a product or service, it’s an interesting Use Case scenario to imagine what if the person using your product or service turns out to [have an abusive spouse](https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/apps-cant-stop-exes-who-use-technology-for-stalking.html)? What conveniences become threats? This represents [less of an edge case](https://ncadv.org/statistics) than anyone would want. via [Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/03/intimate_partne.html)
*   Does your bank [protect your security well](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/what-is-your-banks-security-banking-on/)? Krebs talks about how some banks still use publicly available static identifiers and why that risks everybody.

### Reflect

Feeling dumb or stupid about how not-l33t you are? Angsting over some silly thing you “know better than to do.” Stop. That isn’t useful. Regret is only of use if it prompts an actual change in behavior. Maybe it’s NOT you that sucks. Could be it’s the technology and you could come up with a fix that would help lots of people. [Look forward and make a plan.](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-add-self-review-to-tuesday-checklist/)
