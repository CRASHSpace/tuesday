Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and I hope you’re already heading to the CRASH Space meeting…)

So starting next week I’m updating the format of the Tuesday Sweeps to follow a “zone system” where each week of the month will look harder at one aspect of digital life. The quarterly sweeps will will be broken out as their own thing and posted on a Friday b/c isn’t it just that more realistic that people would make time on a weekend? The loose plan for the zones is below. Feedback welcome.

*   Connectivity (ISPs, Routers, mobile plans, VPNs, etc.)
*   Identity (Passwords, 2FA, scanning for identity theft)
*   Permissions (Settings on devices, plugins, Apps, etc)
*   Do No Harm (Focused on DIY projects)
*   (5th Tuesday Special??)

### Jump in Here

*   Welcome. If you haven’t been following along, it’s okay. You’re not behind, you’re just where you are.
*   The [coach tool](http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com/coach.html) at the [Crash Override Network](http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com/) has a great step by step break down that makes it really easy to start.
*   If that site doesn’t fit your needs or you want more, that’s okay, there are more recommendations under [Start Here](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/start/) on the repo.
*   Feeling more ambitious? Review the list of [OneThing](https://blog.crashspace.org/tag/onething/) articles and pick one to catch up on.

### Sweep

The basics slightly revised and with a [printable checklist](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/sweep/printable_checklist.html).

*   [Updated software](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-routine-update-everything/) recently? Pick a new device to check on today.
*   [Backups](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-sweep-where-are-your-backups/) still up and running? When was the last time you made a clean [disk image](https://blog.crashspace.org/2017/01/one-thing-to-do-today-keep-a-clean-disk-image-on-hand/)? Here’s a new great article on how to design [a backup system](https://www.grahamcluley.com/create-robust-data-backup-plan-make-sure-works/).
*   App, Password Gardening: Delete a [low quality app](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-institute-beyonce-rules-for-vetting-apps/) from your phone or [delete](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-turn-off-image-loading-for-email/) [an](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-turn-off-image-loading-for-email/) [account](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-delete-your-account/) that you don’t need that doesn’t make you happy. Digital cruft builds up. Delete it. If you’re keeping it, can you move the password to your [password manager](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-what-passwords-do-you-have-anyway/) (delete it from everywhere else) and add [two factor authentication](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-enable-two-factor-authorization/)?
*   Stored WiFi networks can be used to [profile your computer](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/when-apps-collude-to-steal-your-data/522177/) and find out [places you’ve been](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/your-android-device-telling-world-where-youve-been). [Weed them out](http://www.tomsguide.com/faq/id-2322427/erase-previous-connections-laptop.html).
*   Move to offline archive & delete your histories where you can [find them](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7028918).
*   Double check [privacy settings](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-if-one-must-use-social-media-follow-army-rules/) on your phone, [social media accounts](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/protecting-yourself-social-networks). The folks running the companies can change the TOS and add “[features](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/facebook-groups-reducing-risks)” before you notice them.

### Learn

Where do you [scan for news](https://crashspace.github.io/tuesday/)?

*   Go Team Young People. So good.
*   So I’m pretty “cuffed” that news coverage of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica hasn’t faded away this time. Many experts have been [blowing this horn](https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads) a [very long time](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/opinion/facebook-cambridge-analytica.html), but hope fully this [time will be different](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/why-facebooks-data-scandal-just-wont-quit)? They’re even talking about it [on CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/26/opinions/data-company-spying-opinion-schneier/).
*   What I hope that people learn isn’t that their shouldn’t so much be a tech backlash, but an exploitive business plan backlash. Want to make sure your venture does things better? [Here’s a guide](https://www.csrandthelaw.com/2016/04/01/managing-users-rights-responsibly-a-guide-for-early-stage-companies/) out of the [Cyberlaw Clinic](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/teaching/cyberlawclinic) at Harvard.
*   Whatever Facebook has done, at least they aren’t doing it [at the Silicon level](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/03/adding_backdoor.html). Ooof. Excuse me while I try to forget that I read this…
*   Jigsaw (an Alphabet company) has released [self-hosted VPN software](https://www.wired.com/story/alphabet-outline-vpn-software/) that works well with Digital Ocean. This is good.
*   New recurring event at the space! “Crypto Robots, CAD and Code” Kyle Cothern will be teaching about robots and sticking around for questions. Session 1 is April 7\. [Space is limited](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-robots-cad-and-code-session-1-tickets-44541313267).
*   I’ve been learning how to use Fusion360 and I found this short video of a [Dad turning his kid’s hand drawn sketches into a 3D printed toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=441&v=UFz0WAPDWC4&ab_channel=ILikeToMakeStuff) charming and full of tips. via [Makezine](https://makezine.com/2018/03/19/turning-kids-drawing-3d-printed-toy/)
*   But what I really want to do is 3D print chairs… [Metal Ones](https://www.designboom.com/design/john-briscella-metal-chairs-3d-print-03-19-2018/) [Plastic Ones](https://www.designboom.com/design/nagami-zaha-hadid-ross-lovegrove-daniel-widrig-milan-design-week-03-22-2018/)
*   I use git all the time and, lets face it, I have no idea how it really works under the hood. Safia Abdalla’s done a killer job [breaking down](https://blog.safia.rocks/post/172273926295/a-complete-story-of-what-happens-when-you-run-git) “how Git-specific data structures, filesystem artifacts, and user input all connect.”
*   Member Jay Jacobs brought the [Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/latest-newsletter/) to my attention this week. It’s a lovely reminder of how creative and nutty and flirty with destruction humanity’s been all freakin’ along. We’re just so so ugly and weird and glorious. Let’s celebrate that about everyone.

### Reflect

Feeling dumb or stupid about how not-l33t you are? Angsting over some silly thing you “know better than to do.” Stop. That isn’t useful. Regret is only of use if it prompts an actual change in behavior. Maybe it’s NOT you that sucks. Could be it’s the technology and you could come up with a fix that would help lots of people. [Look forward and make a plan.](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-add-self-review-to-tuesday-checklist/)
