Post on [CRASH Space](https://blog.crashspace.org/2018/02/tuesday-sweep-6-february-2018/)
Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to go to the CRASH Space meeting…)

As I am writing up I am listening to the Senate Hearing: [Data Security and Bug Bounty Programs: Lessons Learned from the Uber Breach and Security Researchers](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=73871FA8-29AD-4ED5-ABB8-C86B4BE4E0A3)

### Jump in Here

*   Welcome. If you haven’t been following along, it’s okay. You’re not behind, you’re just where you are.
*   The [coach tool](http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com/coach.html) at the [Crash Override Network](http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com/) has a great step by step break down that makes it really easy to start.
*   If that site doesn’t fit your needs or you want more, that’s okay, there are more recommendations under [Start Here](https://carlynorama.github.io/tuesday/start/) on the repo.
*   Feeling more ambitious? Review the list of [OneThing](https://blog.crashspace.org/tag/onething/) articles and pick one to catch up on.

### Sweep

The basics slightly revised and with a [printable checklist](https://carlynorama.github.io/tuesday/sweep/printable_checklist.html).

*   [Updated software](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-routine-update-everything/) recently? Pick a new device to check on today.
*   [Backups](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-sweep-where-are-your-backups/) still up and running? When was the last time you made a clean [disk image](https://blog.crashspace.org/2017/01/one-thing-to-do-today-keep-a-clean-disk-image-on-hand/)? Here’s a new great article on how to design [a backup system](https://www.grahamcluley.com/create-robust-data-backup-plan-make-sure-works/).
*   App, Password Gardening: Delete a [low quality app](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-institute-beyonce-rules-for-vetting-apps/) from your phone or [delete](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-turn-off-image-loading-for-email/) [an](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-turn-off-image-loading-for-email/) [account](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-delete-your-account/) that you don’t need that doesn’t make you happy. Digital cruft builds up. Delete it. If you’re keeping it, can you move the password to your [password manager](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-what-passwords-do-you-have-anyway/) (delete it from everywhere else) and add [two factor authentication](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-enable-two-factor-authorization/)?
*   Stored WiFi networks can be used to [profile your computer](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/when-apps-collude-to-steal-your-data/522177/) and find out [places you’ve been](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/your-android-device-telling-world-where-youve-been). [Weed them out](http://www.tomsguide.com/faq/id-2322427/erase-previous-connections-laptop.html).
*   Move to offline archive & delete your histories where you can [find them](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7028918).
*   Double check [privacy settings](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/12/one-thing-to-do-today-if-one-must-use-social-media-follow-army-rules/) on your phone, [social media accounts](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/protecting-yourself-social-networks). The folks running the companies can change the TOS and add “[features](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/facebook-groups-reducing-risks)” before you notice them.

*   I just really like these [Paper Campers](https://www.designboom.com/art/vera-van-wolferen-paper-campers-02-04-2018/) by vera van wolferen.

### Reflect

Feeling dumb or stupid about how not-l33t you are? Angsting over some silly thing you “know better than to do.” Stop. That isn’t useful. Regret is only of use if it prompts an actual change in behavior. Maybe it’s NOT you that sucks. Could be it’s the technology and you could come up with a fix that would help lots of people. [Look forward and make a plan.](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-add-self-review-to-tuesday-checklist/)

## Relax

Did you know that there were [THOUSANDS of images](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/) in the public domain at the Library of Congress? Introduce yourself to a bunch of them with this [Photo Roulette game](https://loc-photo-roulette.glitch.me/) that asks you to guess the date of a random image from the collection. [Made with glitch](https://glitch.com/).
