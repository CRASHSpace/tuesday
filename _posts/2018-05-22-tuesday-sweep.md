Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

Zone 4 this week: Last month I called it “Do No Harm”, but I’m changing the name to “Leave it Better.” Trying to not be part of the problem can be harder than it feels like it should be. It’s so fun and joyful to just finally get something online, worrying about whether or not it will be a bot two seconds later feels like an extra burden. Yey let me offer up the idea that not contributing to the pollution honors our craft, and cleaning up other people’s mistakes honors the community. Be the type of hiker that packs an extra bag of trash down the mountain. Leave the internet _better_.
