Your weekly reminder to back up your data, update software and otherwise pay attention to your digital environment. (Oh, and to head to the CRASH Space meeting…)

When does fall start? Well, according to [Astronomical Calendars](https://www.almanac.com/content/first-day-seasons), Saturday, September 22, 2018, at exactly 6:54 P.M. PST marks the moment of the Fall Equinox. According to [Meteorological Calendars](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/meteorological-versus-astronomical-seasons) September 1st kicked off Pumpkin Latte season. Here in SoCal, the warm growing season wraps up this month, with the cool growing season kicking off in October. LA Unified [started instruction](https://achieve.lausd.net/domain/36) about two weeks ago, although I still think of September as the start of school. In fact, September marked the beginning of the civic calendar back since it really was the [Seventh Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_(Roman_month)). Jewish Communities will be celebrating a New Years that goes back for thousands of years in [less than a week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar) and it’s time to get your [moon cakes](https://chinatownla.com/wp1/event/80th-annual-mid-autumn-moon-festival/). This time of year has cultivated it’s [liminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality) vibe for eons. So let’s go with that.

What does that mean for this week? We return to the theme of Connectivity. How do we connect? What do we connect to? This week time though, in honor of September, spend a little bit of time thinking – Why do we connect at all?

*   Bruce Schneier has a new book called [Click Here To Kill Everybody](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/09/new_book_announ.html) ([Amazon Affil Link](https://www.amazon.com/Click-Here-Kill-Everybody-Hyper-connected/dp/0393608883/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=nav_signin&&linkCode=ll1&tag=orama0a-20&linkId=eb8719e7324e2d66c7e472b3f32bc7a3&language=en_US) | [Publisher Link](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294996830) (no SSL))
*   Please call your Senators, even here in CA, to prevent the Kavanaugh Confirmation. Calling Senators that support your position helps [keep them strong](https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/09/democrats-kavanaugh-confirmation.html). It’s easier to prevent a nomination
*   Go [Net Neutrality in CA](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/calif-senate-approves-net-neutrality-rules-sends-bill-to-governor/). Governor still needs to sign, so might as well [give him a call](https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov39mail/), and make she he knows that Californias think it’s worth fighting for and to prevent them from weakening it as people [keep trying](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484836/california-net-neutrality-bill-amendment-democrat-senator). While you have them on the phone, say YAY for [carbon-free energy too](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/governors-desk-last-stop-to-california-pledging-100-carbon-free-energy-by-2045/)!

### Relax

I have a plant acquisition problem. I don’t always have a too many plants in my yard problem, because well, in our heat, let’s just say they weed themselves. That said I got a ton of <del>sacrifices</del> new members of the family while stopping at the [Drought Resistant Nursery](http://www.droughtresistant.com) in Monterey last week. You can blame my jaunt along the coast for why y’all didn’t get a Tuesday sweep. I brought home a ton of [Salvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia)‘s a couple of [osteospermum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteospermum) and a ([not pictured](https://blog.crashspace.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_4798.jpg)) [Arbutus Marina](https://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/arbutus-marina).
