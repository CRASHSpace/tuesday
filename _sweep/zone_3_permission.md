### Start Up
- Write a list of all the places that you provide data. Social Networks, Email, Home IoT, Fitness Apps, Meditation Apps, Online Video games... At the very least most of these places will keep a record of where you logged in from at what time. What are their privacy policies?
- Get rid of the “junk-food” apps and accounts that don’t actually provide value, improve your life.
- For the ones that do have value to you is there a way to mitigate the potential harm of a data leak?
- Switch your default search engine on your computers and phones
- Install privacy protecting browser plugins.

### Maintain
- Double check privacy settings on your phone
- Check the privacy setting on social media accounts
- Transfer email to an offline archive, delete email off the server that is more than 6 months old
- Delete your histories where you can find them.
