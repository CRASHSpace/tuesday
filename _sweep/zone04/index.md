### Start Up
*   Write a list of all the websites you run, hardware projects that are online, software bots, 3D printers, etc.
*   HTTPs… everywhere. Make a goal for no unencrypted traffic for anything. It’s a good step one.
*   Research the best practices for each project to the best of your ability. Here are a few papers targeting different aspects of the problems, sadly, none targeted at the hobbyist. (I’ll keep looking.)
    *   [Managing Users’ Rights Responsibly – A Guide for Early-Stage Companies](http://www.csrandthelaw.com/2016/04/01/managing-users-rights-responsibly-a-guide-for-early-stage-companies/)
    *   [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) – [The Ten Most Critical Web Application Security Risks 2017](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_2017_Project)
    *   [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) – [Building the New Network Security Architecture for the Future](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/building-network-security-architecture-future-38255)
    *   [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/future-iot-networks/iot-security-guidelines/) – [IoT Security Guidelines Overview](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-security-guidelines-overview-document/), and [Assessment](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-security-assessment/) (hilariously, a .docx)

### Maintain
- Patch your installs (Wordpress, drupal, Django... you name it)
*   Update, backup, check the logs every item on the list from the startup section. If something presents too much of a hassle to maintain, consider unplugging it/shutting down. Better off than a bot.
  * [Tips from serverfault](http://serverfault.com/questions/2783/how-do-i-know-if-my-linux-server-has-been-hacked)
  * [Tips from StackExcahange](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7443/how-do-you-know-your-server-has-been-compromised)
*   If you found a security problem in one of your projects, announce and update the documentation so others will fix their versions, too. Don’t be embarrassed. It’s a hard problem. Everyone makes mistakes. It’s how they get fixed that matters.
*   If you’ve found a security problem in someone else’s project… [ideal world advice](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/)… do your best to make sure they get a polite heads up before you announce it with some lead time to develop a fix. Not forever, but some. Sadly, [this isn’t an ideal world](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/vulnerability-reporting-faq), but you can call your representative(s) to make security research (and thus the whole darn internet) safer for everyone.
*   A friend has a great phrase she uses with her kids – “Hey, are you filling [your sibling’s]sails or taking the air out?” She’s reminding them that they’re on the same team, and that it’s better to be motivating than demotivating. People who make things… we’re a tribe. When talking about other people’s projects, try communicating in a way that moves them forward rather than swamps them into inaction. Community, it’s the best and the worst, and it’s up to us.
