## Why This

Why this? Because working on projects and being in communities ideally should be a source of joy not a drain. Burn out can happens so quickly when we put ourselves constantly on the line for things that don't feel like they care back. Guido van Rossum, inventor of Python, [now sick of the Python community.](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html) Game Devs sick of [toxic](https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/10/17550276/guild-wars-2-arenanet-firings-jessica-price-gamergate) [gamers](https://kotaku.com/game-designer-says-developers-would-be-more-candid-if-g-1818729507). Conference goers, sick of conferences that give [a long leash to toxic personalities](https://medium.com/@nofashathope/statement-no-fascists-at-hope-c6873a64cc94), sapping energy away from everyone else. When toxic people show up, not shutting down bad behavior FAST isn't simply "letting things work out", it's a decision to drive away good people who don't want to be around that level of bullsh*t.

Boundary formation plays an important role in the development of self, and it [takes work to get it right](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/great-self-care-setting-healthy-boundaries/). Individuals need boundaries, like what time they stop working on any given day, to make room for their complete identity. Communities hopefully form boundaries so that bullies donâ€™t march in and start sucking all the oxygen out of the room. The [Paradox of Tolerance](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/2017/09/10/the-intolerable-speech-rule-the-paradox-of-tolerance-for-tech-companies/) requires us not to allow folks to bring poison to the pot lucks we host.
