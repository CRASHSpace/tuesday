## Why This

## Getting Started

- Write a list of all the websites you run, hardware projects that are online, software bots, 3D printers, etc.
- Which are vulnerable? Which have a known update path.
- Don't be afraid to shut vulnerable items down. They served their purpose. Take a screenshot and let it go.
- Know what to look for:

  * [Tips from StackExcahange](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7443/how-do-you-know-your-server-has-been-compromised)

## Maintenance mode

- Put them on a schedule, even quarterly or annual updates will put you ahead of some major corps!
- Unplug what you aren't willing to update. Really.
