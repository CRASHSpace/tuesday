## Why This

## Getting Started

*   HTTPs… everywhere. Make a goal for no unencrypted traffic for anything. It’s a good step one.
*   Research the best practices for each project to the best of your ability. Here are a few papers targeting different aspects of the problems, sadly, none targeted at the hobbyist. (I’ll keep looking.)
    *   [Managing Users’ Rights Responsibly – A Guide for Early-Stage Companies](http://www.csrandthelaw.com/2016/04/01/managing-users-rights-responsibly-a-guide-for-early-stage-companies/)
    *   [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) – [The Ten Most Critical Web Application Security Risks 2017](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_2017_Project)
    *   [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) – [Building the New Network Security Architecture for the Future](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/building-network-security-architecture-future-38255)
    *   [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/future-iot-networks/iot-security-guidelines/) – [IoT Security Guidelines Overview](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-security-guidelines-overview-document/), and [Assessment](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-security-assessment/) (hilariously, a .docx)
