### Start Up
- Write a list of the major online accounts that could be used to gain access to other accounts, such as email, telcos, hosting services, and financial services
- Put all the passwords for those accounts into a password manager, updating them to something stronger
- Enable 2FA for all of these accounts if that is an option.
- Encrypt your hard drive(s). Keep this password(s) somewhere safe.
- Be careful who you keep in your official contacts list. These can be requested by Apps and plugins. 

### Maintain
- Check your financial accounts for weird transactions
- Check for super old passwords in your password manager
- Continue to move all passwords into the password manager
- Check haveibeenpwned.com
- Did you let papers to shred pile up? Take care of that now.
