### Start Up

*   Write a list of the major online accounts that could be used to gain access to other accounts, such as email, telcos, hosting services, and financial services. These will be the most important to get secure, and maintain their security.
*   Put all the passwords for those accounts into a password manager, updating them to something stronger.
*   DELETE those passwords from any browsers, google docs, contact files, Evernote files, system keychains, random text files, etc. that you’ve had them stored.
*   Enable 2FA for all of these accounts for which it is an option. ANY two factor is fine at this point. Just do it.
*   Check all your email address in haveibeenpwned.com, change these passwords next.
*   Get in the habit of not clicking links in messages. It’s annoying, I know. Try to navigate to the site directly and then find the page. If the link’s been shortened got to [a search engine’s home page](https://www.ixquick.com/) and paste it there. Most will unshorten the link for you.
*   Be careful who you keep in your official contacts list. These can be sucked down by Apps and plugins.
*   Check your credit, heck, freeze your credit.
*   Do an internet search for your physical address, phone numbers. See what comes up.

### Maintain

*   Check your financial accounts for weird transactions, this can be how it starts.
*   Check your emails, including the spam folder, for messages that might mean someone stole your credentials… BUT DON’T CLICK THE LINKS. This style of email is very popular amongst phishers. Type in the site address yourself. ([latest scams reported by FTC](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/scam-alerts))
*   Check for weak & duplicate passwords in your password manager
*   Check for super old passwords in your password manager
*   Continue to move all passwords into the password manager and DELETE THEM from other places, like browsers and system keychains.
*   Use these activities as an excuse to delete accounts that aren’t in use.
*   Did you let papers to shred pile up? Take care of that now.
