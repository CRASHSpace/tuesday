## I am the weakest link

1. What did I do that I knew better than? Why?
2. What would have made it easier to do the right thing?
3. Change: Make it, schedule making it, ask the community, drop a note.

## Perimeter

* Software up to date
* Check logs / traffic patterns
* Check processes
* any new files?
* who's new? remind them that their password shouldn't suck.
