This third Tuesday Sweep of the month focuses on "Permissions." The old saying goes "if you give 'em an inch, they'll take a mile," and for many technology products that seems to be their motto for data collection. But not all products, and not all setting levels on all products.Â  This week think about the items and software you've let in the door, so to speak, and make sure they are being proper guests.
