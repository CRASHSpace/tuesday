## Why This


## Getting Started

* Install the password manager that works for you (Lastpass seems to be the most common) on
  * You main computer
  * Any tablets and smart phones
  * As browser plugins
* Write a list of the major online accounts that could be used to gain access to other accounts, such as email, social media, telcos, hosting services. These will be the most important to get secure, and maintain their security.
* Put all the passwords for those accounts into a password manager.
* Update these passwords to something unique and as long as they'll let you.
* DELETE passwords from any browsers, google docs, contact files, Evernote files, system keychains, random text files, etc. that you’ve had them stored.

## Maintenance mode

* If your [password manager](../zone00/password_manager.md) flags a password, change it.
  *  Check for weak & duplicate passwords in your password manager
  *  Check for super old passwords in your password manager
*   Continue to move all passwords into the password manager and DELETE THEM from other places, like browsers and system keychains.
*   Use these activities as an excuse to delete accounts that aren’t in use.
* Take a minute to think about your week and see if you remember anything you forgot to put in the manager right away. Maybe you had to make a new password while away from your own computer, phone or using a different browser without a plugin. Maybe someone made up a password for you and gave it to you. Maybe you used to keep info somewhere else, like a contact manager. There a lots of reasons that passwords or bits of data that should be more safely saved can get littered about.
