##Why This


##Getting Started

* Install the one that works for you (Lastpass seems to be the most common) on
  * You main computer
  * Any tablets and smart phones
  * As browser plugins

##Maintenance mode

Maybe you had to make a new password while away from your own computer, phone or using a different browser without a plugin. Maybe someone made up a password for you and gave it to you. Maybe you used to keep info somewhere else, like a contact manager. There a lots of reasons that passwords or bits of data that should be more safely saved can get littered about. Take a minute to think about your week and see if you remember anything you forgot to put in the manager right away.
