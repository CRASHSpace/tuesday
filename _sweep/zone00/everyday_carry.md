##Why This

Being under pressure makes people make decisions they wouldn't normally, like plugging a smart phone in to an unknown USB port to charge, etc. Have daily basics charged, packed, ready to go can prevent desperation decisions.

##Getting Started

There are lots of folks online demonstrating their "EDC," but don't just add the weight of other people's "shoulds".  Make a list of the bags/wallets/vehicles that you naturally take with you and think about what's right to carry in each of them.

From a internet privacy and security standpoint, these would be the three items that I put high on my list, but these situations might not come up for you.

* Charging cables, either battery backup or wall charger or both to prevent plugging in to strange cables or ports.
* [Live USB Boot Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB) to prevent having to leave traces on someone else's machine.
* Travel hot-spot to get emergency coverage and to prevent the temptation to join a public network unprepared.  

At the end of the page I've put a brain dump. Pick and choose what works for you, and make a check list for each place that should be restocked each week.
