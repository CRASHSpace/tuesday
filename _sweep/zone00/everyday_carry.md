## Why This

Being under pressure makes people make decisions they wouldn't normally, like plugging a smart phone in to an unknown USB port to charge, etc. Have daily basics charged, packed, ready to go can prevent desperation decisions.

## Getting Started

There are lots of folks online demonstrating their "EDC," but don't just add the weight of other people's "shoulds".  Make a list of the bags/wallets/vehicles that you naturally take with you and think about what's right to carry in each of them. Make a checklist for each bag.

From a internet privacy and security standpoint, these would be the  items to consider.

* Charging cables, either battery backup or wall charger or both to prevent plugging in to strange cables or ports.
* [Live USB Boot Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB) to prevent having to leave traces on someone else's machine.
* Travel hot-spot to get emergency coverage and to prevent the temptation to join a public network unprepared.
* Relevant [security tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token) if you've gone that route for [Two Factor Authorization](../zone02/2FA.md).

## Maintenance mode

For each bag/vehicle:

* Empty out the trash
* If there's any forgotten business like business cards or receipts take care of them immediately.  
* Restock from checklist
* Replace items that expire
