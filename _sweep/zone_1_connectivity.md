### Start Up
- Write a list of all the places you connect to the internet and how you get on the internet from that location.
- Who are the ISPs you interact with? If you use data on your phone, include the phone company. If you use a VPN, they can (even if they have a policy against) collect the same type information. Locate all of their privacy policies. If they screw up, how will you know? Who can you complain to?
- Do you use public WiFi networks?
	- Do you have your firewall up?
	- Do you have HTTPs everywhere installed and activated?
- When was the last time you logged into your router? Have you changed the password? Do you know the password?

### Maintain
- Any new choices for ISP in your neighborhood?
- Stored WiFi networks can be used to profile your computer and find out places you’ve been. Weed them out.
- Check the activity logs on your router.
- Check your firewall settings.
- Might be a good week to call the city and see if municipal broadband might be coming to you…
