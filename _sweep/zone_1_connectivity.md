### Start Up
- Write a list of all the places you connect to the internet and how you get on the internet from that location.
	- Who are the ISPs you interact with? If you use data on your phone, include the phone company. If you use a VPN, they can (even if they have a policy against) collect the same type information.
	- Locate all as many of the privacy policies as you can. If they screw up, how will you know? Who can you complain to?
Set up for safety on public WiFi networks
	- Do you have a firewall up and running?
	- Do you have HTTPs everywhere installed and FULLY activated? It can be really annoying but using a public WiFi requires extra care to not allow any unencrypted connections. No exceptions.
	- VPN's: if one really has to take care of business on a public network, this is the use case. Ars Technica pronounces the commercial providers as one big "meh," but this may be a case of the devil you know vs. the one you don't. Need extra safety? Consider rolling your own?
- When was the last time you logged into your home's router? Have you changed the password? Do you know the password?
- You may not ever use Tor, but one of these Zone 1 weeks will be a good time to learn about Tor and Onion Routers in general.

### Maintain
- Any new choices for ISP in your neighborhood?
- What new hardware do you have?
    -   Is it set up correctly?
    -   How does it stay up to date and backed up?
    -   Is it on your check list?
- Stored WiFi networks can be used to profile your computer and find out places you’ve been. Weed them out.
- Check the activity logs on your router.
- Check your firewall settings.
- Might be a good week to call the city and see if municipal broadband might be coming to you…
