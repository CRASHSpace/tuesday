## Why This

Some small random unrecognized transaction could be your first clue of identity theft. Banks will tend to be pretty helpful when a report comes quickly.

## Getting Started

* Make a list of all your financial services accounts. Not just banks, including paypal and venmo and the like.
* Makesure all those passwords are in that [password manager](../zone00/password_manager.md).
* If you haven't recently, get a copy of your credit report. Consider freezing your credit, as well.

## Maintenance mode

* Log in to every account and check your transaction history.
* If you see something you don't recognize report it immediately.
