## Why This

## Getting Started

* Buy a cross cutting shredder.
* If dealing with a big back log, consider a service. Unless you're seriously a target the bin at the UPS store should be just fine, but there are other services you'd just be more comfortable witnessing the shredding yourself.

## Maintenance mode

* If things have your name and address on them, shred it. If that seems too much, at least do financial docs.
