## How’s the Tuesday Sweep been working for you?

*   Is the day and time right?
*   Is it time to update the threat model?
*   Is your check list still appropriate?
*   Is where you get your news still current?
*   Do you still have your camera covered or other visual reminder?  

## Updates

* Login to your router and check what devices are connected. Are they all on your checklist of things to update?
  * Computers, phones, tablets, gaming systems, IoT devices, printers, random DIY projects, etc.
* What's been too low priority to do every week? Do that now.
* SSL Certificates for your sites. When do they expire? (You need to have one by [July of 2018](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html))

## Back Ups,  Arichive

*   Try restoring your systems from back up. It’s not a [back-up system](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-sweep-where-are-your-backups/) if it doesn’t work.
*   If you don’t have a cloud-based back up program, when was the last time you swapped the offsite copy of your files?
*   If not part of weekly tasks, move email to offline backup

## Software Review

*   Fall quarter emphasized planning software updates and code overhauls. What have you done?
*   Software as a service check:
    *   Are all your subscription up to date?
    *   Anyone billing you who shouldn’t be? (Check your credit card bills for misc charges)

## Hardware Review

*   What new hardware do you have?
    *   Is it set up correctly?
    *   How does it stay up to date and backed up?
    *   Is it on your check list?
*   What hardware seems on it’s last legs? Hardrive motors fail. Computer cords get chewed on...
*   Batteries get old, how’s yours doing? [Can it be replaced](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/08/battery-replacements-sometimes-one-per-iphone/)?
*   [Oil your paper shredder](https://lifehacker.com/5875771/oil-your-paper-shredder-with-canola-oil-to-keep-it-running-in-top-shape).

## Personal Information & Emergency Supplies

*   Get a copy of a credit report from a different reporting bureaus than you did last fall. Check to make sure your credit is still frozen.
*   When was the last time you checked the validity of your Emergency Plan and the content of both your stay-kit and go-bag?
    *   [California Resources](http://www.caloes.ca.gov/)
    *   [Federal Resources](https://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan)
    *   [SF72.org](http://www.sf72.org/) (San Francisco Department of Emergency Management)
*   What is perishable in your emergency kit? What is it time to rotate? (Energy bars? Water? Batteries?)
*   Anything to add to stay-kit or go-bag?
