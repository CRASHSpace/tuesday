Misc to incorporate


### Meta
- Does Tuesday even work for you? Change the time on your calendar to what works for you.
- Do you have a camera cover on your laptop… that makes you happy?
- Do you have a personal privacy policy?  

### Update Lists
- Check your list of devices that connect to the internet and places you connect anything new? One way to look is to log into the router and check mac addresses.
- Have your connectivity providers changed?
- Is it time to update your list of elected officials?
- Who’s on your news list? Rotate that up a bit, hear some new voices.

### Back Ups,  Arichive

*   Try restoring your systems from back up. It’s not a [back-up system](https://blog.crashspace.org/2016/11/one-thing-to-do-today-tuesday-sweep-where-are-your-backups/) if it doesn’t work.
*   If you don’t have a cloud-based back up program, when was the last time you swapped the offsite copy of your files?
*   If not part of weekly tasks, move email to offline backup

### Identity
- Ask for your data
	____ Credit Bureaus: (Experian, Equifax, )
	____ Google
	____ Social Networks (Facebook companies, Snapchat, Twitter)



###Do No Harm
- SSL Certificates for your sites. When do they expire? (You need to have one by [July of 2018](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html)). While you're at it, do you really need all those domain names? Maybe choose some to let expire.
